# APB_MULTI_SLAVE_DESIGN
--> This project is compatible with AMBA APB (ADVANCE PERIPHERAL BUS).

âœ… PROJECT OVERVIEW âœ…                                                
--> This project implements an AMBA APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) architecture with 3 slave devices, an 8-bit address bus, and a 32-bit data bus. The master interface communicates with slaves using address decoding, ready/valid handshakes, and error signaling.                  
--> The design enables communication between a master (or processor/HLE) and multiple APB slaves in a simple, efficient, and low-power manner.

--> The APB protocol is widely used in SoC designs for connecting low-bandwidth peripherals such as timers, GPIO, UART, and more.                             
--> This project serves as a reference design and learning resource for students, beginners, and professionals working in SoC/RTL design and verification.


âœ… FEATURES âœ…                              
--> Master Interface: A single master (processor/HLE) initiates read/write transactions.              
--> 3 APB Slaves: Each slave can be independently accessed via address decoding logic.             
--> Address Decoder: Routes master transactions to the correct slave.                        
--> Read/Write Support: Handles both read and write transactions at one time.                   
--> Protocol Compliance: Follows APB standard handshake mechanism (PSEL, PENABLE, PREADY).              
--> Reusable Logic: Modular Verilog implementation for scalability.       


âœ… DESIGN SPECIFICATION âœ…        
   ðŸ”¹ Address Decoding (Slave Selection)                   
      --> Master Interface has to access any of 3 slave then he has some specific address value to decode the slave                                      
      PADDR = 8'h00 â†’ APB Slave 1 selected                            
      PADDR = 8'h01 â†’ APB Slave 2 selected                         
      PADDR = 8'h02 â†’ APB Slave 3 selected                            
      PADDR = 8'h03 â†’ No Slave Selected â†’ generates error interrupt to master                         

   ðŸ”¹ Ready Signal (PREADY)                               
      --> Each slave can insert a programmable wait state.                           
      --> PREADY can be delayed 1 to 16 cycles before transaction completion.                          
   
   ðŸ”¹ Transaction Rules                                   
      --> At once only one transaction (either read or write) can occur.                                        
      --> Transactions follow standard APB handshake:                               
            PSEL â†’ PENABLE â†’ PREADY â†’ PSLVERR (if any)                           
   
   ðŸ”¹ Error Handling (PSLVERR)                                 
      --> PSLVERR is asserted when:                          
      --> Invalid slave address will be transfered.                      
      --> Accessing beyond defined address range of each slave.                        
      --> Address boundary rules:                     
      Slave 1 â†’ Valid range: 0 â€“ 20 | Reserved: 21 â€“ 64                          
      Slave 2 â†’ Valid range: 0 â€“ 36 | Reserved: 37 â€“ 64                   
      Slave 3 â†’ Valid range: 0 â€“ 54 | Reserved: 55 â€“ 64                        
      --> PSLVERR validity condition:                                     
          PSEL & PENABLE & PREADY must be HIGH simultaneously.                              

  ðŸ”¹ Bus Parameters                                  
     --> Address width: 8 bits                                 
     --> Data width: 32 bits                          
     --> PREADY delay: 1â€“16 cycles
